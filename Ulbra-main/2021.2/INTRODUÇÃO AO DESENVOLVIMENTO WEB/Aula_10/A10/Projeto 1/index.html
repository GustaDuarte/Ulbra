                London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[8][9] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium.
